Ada Lovelace

	Born December 10th, 1815, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was born.  Known more commonly as simply Ada Lovelace, she was an English mathematician and writer and considered by many to be the first computer programmer after writing the first ever algorithm intended to be performed by a machine.
	At a young age, Ada’s talents and passion for mathematics flourished, eventually leading to a friendship and working relationship with fellow mathematician Charles Babbage, who is regarded as “The Father of Computers”.  She helped him work on the analytical engine, one of the earliest forms of a computer.  She also wrote an elaborate set of notes about the engine which she simply titled Notes.  These “notes” contain what is believed to be the first ever computer program (an algorithm that is meant to be performed by a machine), and is thus why she is considered to be the first ever computer programmer.  Ada also had a vision of computers being able to perform much more than simple functions such as calculating or number crunching.  While most others, Charles Babbage included, focused only on the simple capabilities.
	Founded in 2009 by Suw Charman-Anderson, Ada Lovelace day is a day meant to raise the profile of woman in science.  In modern day, woman are severely under represented in the field of not just computer science, but science in general, despite the fact that the first computer program was written by a woman.   However, the beauty of Ada Lovelace day is the fact that it is a day meant not to simply highlight the fact that women are not sufficiently represented in the field of science, but instead is a day meant to celebrate women who have had profound impacts within the scientific community.  Thus hoping to inspire other women to do the same.
